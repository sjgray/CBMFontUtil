; ColourPET+G Font EPROM #1 - by Steve Gray
; =========================
; This file is used to create an EPROM binary file for use with ColourPET+G.
;
; A PET font is 128 characters. The upper 128 "reversed" characters are not stored in the font
; but are produced by inverting pixels using hardware. Each character is 8x8 pixels, and so
; requires 8 bytes per character. One font takes 128x8 = 1KB.
;
; The PET supports a maximum of 4 fonts in its FONT ROM (although most models only had 2).
; Four FONTS are called a FONT SET and contains:
;   Text, Graphics, Alt-Text, Alt-Graphics
;
; The ColourPET+G can have up to 16 FONT SETS in it's EPROM. The following are included:
;
;   Normal, Bold, Underlined, Rotated-90/180/270, Wide-Left/Right, Tall-Top/Bottom,
;   Double-Size (4 quadrants), SuperPET, and German DIN
